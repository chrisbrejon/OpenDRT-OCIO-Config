# OpenDRT-OCIO-Config
Based on Jed Smith's repo https://github.com/jedypod/open-display-transform/ I wanted to create a minimal OCIO config of openDRT 0.3.5 for full CG projects.

This is state-of-the-art / cutting-edge Color Management but in its most minimalistic and simple form.

I don't think you can do a config more "plug and play play" than this one:
- Inputs (textures) are in "linear"
- Rendering and Nuke working space are also in "linear"
- View Transform is for Rec.1886 display

There is no need to go wide gamut or anything complex to make your images look great. Enjoy !
